## reversi_game
a program to determine minimax value for positions of the reversi game.
Given W wieghts in the board
use evaluation function E(s) = Sum(Wi) - Sum(Wj), where i is player cell, j opponent cell.

Implement a alpha-beta search algorithm to output traverse log of the game.

## wedding seating Arrangement

Given M guest and N tables
and pairs for friends and enimies

use SAT encoding to construct clauses and generate CNF sentence for each 
instance of the seating arrangement.

Implement a SAT solver to find satifying assignment for CNF sentences.
using PL-Resolution and WalkSAT algorithm. 

## Decision Network

a decision network use Directed Acyclis grpah to represent a set of random variables 
and their conditional dependencies within a probalistic model.

given several decision nodes, chance nodes, and at most one utility nodes.

Calculate a specific joint, marginal or conditional probability.
Calculate expected utility of a particular decision, or determine the decision with the maximum expected utility.
